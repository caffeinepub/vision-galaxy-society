  "summary": "The diff adds a dedicated startup error screen with Retry/Logout/Hard Reload actions, wires it into the app’s startup/auth gate when the caller profile query errors, and implements a best-effort hard reload utility that clears Cache Storage and unregisters service workers before reloading. No evidence suggests modifications to the read-only shadcn UI components or immutable hook files.",
